# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This project is a modernized and slightly simplified version of the original game from [KevinMarquesP's Snake Game](https://github.com/kevinmarquesp/snake_game). The game is implemented using Python's `curses` library and features a simple menu, a playable snake game, and a scoreboard to keep track of your high scores.
